## Capabilities:

#### Logging

- Configure ecKit loggers to e.g. direct output to Fortran units
- Multiple log channels ( info, debug, warning, error )
- Each log channel may be configured with multiple destinations ( Fortran unit, file, none )

#### MPI

- Wraping of MPI functions (allreduce, broadcast, alltoall, allgather, ...)
- Depending on environment variables set by mpirun, aprun, srun, the real MPI or a serial MPI
implementation is selected at runtime, so that no ```mpi_serial``` dummy library is required for serial jobs.

#### Exception handling

- C++ exceptions are handled by a custom terminate function
- This terminate function calls a configurable routine to abort the program

#### Configuration

- Configuration can be read from a YAML or JSON file
- Access configuration by key-value with key being a string
- Compatible with ecKit configuration (can be passed as argument)

#### C/Fortran interoperability
- Helper functions to convert strings, arrays

## fctest

Unit Testing Framwork for Fortran, made easy.

- C Preprocessor Macros are used to make writing tests extremely fast
- Tests in one file are bundled in a Test Suite (Fortran Module)
- Python script generates a main program for a Test Suite
- Driven by CMake build system ( and ctest )

#### To use fctest in your ecbuild project

Simply add following line to your project's CMakeLists.txt

```
ecbuild_add_option( FEATURE FCTEST  DEFAULT ${ENABLE_TESTS}
                    DESCRIPTION "Fortran Unit Testing Framework"
                    REQUIRED_PACKAGES "PROJECT fckit" )
```

See src/examples folder how to add and create the unit-tests.
